    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Puri</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix sooji, maida, baking soda and salt in a wide mouth vessel.
        </li>
        <li>
            add warm water little by little to knead a stiff dough. The stiffness should be same as for the puris.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover it with a damp muslin cloth and keep it aside for 30 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
            make small equal lemon sized balls of the dough. Do remember to keep them covered with damp muslin cloth
            while making more balls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now with the help of some dry maida, roll out thin rotis. Make them round with the help of a round cookie
            cutter or lid of any container.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Points to remember before frying</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Always ensure that the oil is hot before frying otherwise the puris will soak in excess oil and will not
            puff. Put a small testing puri. If it comes up fast then the oil is rightly hot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Also the oil should not be smoking hot or the puris will get burnt and dark.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        Heat oil in a deep bottom pan or kadai and put 3 - 4 puris in the kadai and fry them with the help of a
        slotted spoon.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        While frying, press them in the center allow them to puff up. We want a pocket in each and every puri.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Now flip them over and let them cook. Take them out on a kitchen towel when they are light brown and crisp.
        Don't let them get dark in color.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Let them cool. Later store in an airtight container.
    </ul>


    <h2>Pani</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Grind in a hand blender coriander, mint leaves and green chillies to make a fine paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix all the ingredients of the pani along with the green paste. Dissolve the gur properly. Adjust the
            spices and tanginess according to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain through a wire strainer to remove any rough bits. Keep in the refrigerator for 2 -3 hrs before
            serving.
        </li>
        <li>
            To Make The Stuffing : In a bowl mix yellow peas, roughly mashed potatoes and salt. Keep aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            To Serve: Make a small hole on a puri by tapping slowly on the crisp side. Fill some stuffing in the centre
            along with some green chutney, tamarind chutney and some chilled pani prepared earlier. Stir the pani before
            using to mix all the masalas. < /li> </ol> <details>
